# Word-Search-Application-Utilizing-Brute-Force-and-KMP-Algorithms

A flexible word search application that supports both **desktop (Tkinter)** and **web-based (Flask)** interfaces. It utilizes **Brute Force** and **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** string-searching algorithms to locate words across multiple text files. Advanced matching options and performance comparison are built-in.

## Features

### Search Functionality
- Search a keyword across multiple `.txt` files
- Displays:
  - File name
  - Row number
  - Column index (starting position in line)

### Advanced Matching Options
- **Whole Word Match**
  - Checked: Match exact whole words (e.g., "pak" → only "pak")
  - Unchecked: Match substrings too (e.g., "pak" → "Pakistan", "adampak")
- **Case Sensitivity**
  - Checked: Case-sensitive search
  - Unchecked: Case-insensitive (e.g., "Bilal", "bilaL", "BILAL")

### Performance Evaluation
- Implements both **Brute Force** and **KMP** algorithms
- Displays time taken by each algorithm after each search:
  - `Time (Brute Force):`
  - `Time (KMP):`
